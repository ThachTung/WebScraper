eBay Scraper Timeout Issue - Analysis and Solution

I understand the error. The issue is a timeout error when making requests to eBay. Let me explain the problem and provide a solution:
1. Error Explanation:
- The error shows a TimeoutError occurring in the requests.get() call
- The current timeout is set to 10 seconds (timeout=10), which might not be enough time for eBay to respond
- Additionally, making too many requests quickly can trigger eBay's rate limiting
2. Solution:
- Let's modify the script to:
- Increase the timeout duration
- Add delays between requests
- Add error handling for requests
- Implement retries for failed requests

1. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
The script was encountering timeout errors when making requests to eBay. This occurred because:
- The default timeout of 10 seconds was too short
- No retry mechanism for failed requests
- No proper handling of rate limiting
- No delays between requests

2. IMPLEMENTED SOLUTIONS

a) Retry Mechanism Implementation:
   - Added urllib3.util.Retry strategy
   - Configuration:
     * 3 retry attempts
     * Exponential backoff (1, 2, 4 seconds between retries)
     * Retries on specific HTTP status codes (500, 502, 503, 504)

b) Improved Request Handling:
   - Increased timeout from 10 to 30 seconds
   - Added session management for better connection handling
   - Implemented raise_for_status() to catch bad HTTP responses
   - Added proper error handling for all requests

c) Delay Implementation:
   - 2-second delay between page requests
   - 3-second delay between different players
   - 5-second delay when retrying failed first pages
   - Helps avoid eBay's rate limiting

d) Error Handling Improvements:
   - Try-except blocks around critical sections
   - Graceful handling of missing data in listings
   - Continues processing even if some items fail
   - Better error messaging and logging

e) Data Validation:
   - Checks for existence of items before processing
   - Validates all required elements before adding to list
   - Only saves data when items are successfully collected

3. CODE CHANGES SUMMARY

Before:
```python
response = requests.get(url, params=params, timeout=10)
```

After:
```python
# Session setup with retry strategy
retry_strategy = Retry(
    total=3,
    backoff_factor=1,
    status_forcelist=[500, 502, 503, 504]
)
adapter = HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retry_strategy)
session = requests.Session()
session.mount("http://", adapter)
session.mount("https://", adapter)

# Making requests with better error handling
try:
    time.sleep(2)  # Rate limiting prevention
    response = session.get(url, params=params, timeout=30)
    response.raise_for_status()
except requests.RequestException as e:
    # Handle error appropriately
```

4. USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

To use the updated script:
1. Run as normal: python ebayprices.py
2. Expect longer execution times due to implemented delays
3. Watch for error messages in console
4. Check output files for successful data collection

5. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

- The script may still encounter timeouts if eBay's server is slow
- Implemented delays mean slower execution but more reliable data collection
- Consider adjusting delay times if still encountering issues
- Monitor eBay's robots.txt and terms of service for compliance
